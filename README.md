# a06: Create a GitHub Profile!

## Set up your Profile (15pts)

The first step of creating your GitHub profile is to input your information! You want to complete the following steps:

1. **Set a Profile Picture (5pts)**: The profile picture is a great way to personalize your profile, and it helps identify you across GitHub in pull requests and comments. Profiles with profile pictures have greater visibility and helps your profile to appear more professional. Try to use a photo including your face that is presentable in a reasonably professional setting.
    1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
    2. Under "Profile Picture", select  Edit, then click Upload a photo....
    3. Select an image, then click Upload. 
    4. Crop your picture.
    5. Click Set new profile picture.

2. **Include your Name: (2pts)**: By default, GitHub profiles may only include a lowercased username. Make sure to input your name in the appropriate field with proper casing.
    1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
    2. Under "Public profile", in the "Name" field, type the name you want to be displayed on your profile.

3. **Update your Bio (2pts)**: Add a bio to your profile to share information about yourself with other GitHub users! You can include @mentions (to mention organizations or other people), as well as emojis. Bios are very short, so provide a very quick description about you! It is common to include information such as your major / school, as well as a company or organization, if you are a part of it. For example, "CS major @ UNC".
    1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
    2. Under "Public profile", in the "Bio" field, type the content that you want displayed on your profile. The bio field is limited to 160 characters.
    3. Click Update profile.

4. **Include Pronouns (0pts)**: Optionally, you may also choose to include your pronouns.
    1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
    2. Under Pronouns, add the pronouns that you want displayed on your profile. You may add custom pronouns.
    3. Click Update profile.

5. **Location and Timezone (0pts)**: Optionally, include your general location! This will help you be seen by employers near you. You can be general - since you are a student at UNC-Chapel Hill, including Chapel Hill would be reasonable.
    1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
    2. Under "Public profile", in the "Location" field, type the location you want to be displayed on your profile.
    3. Optionally, display the current local time on your profile.
    4. Select Display current local time.
    5. Select the Time zone dropdown menu, then click your local time zone.
    6. Click Update profile.

6. **Social Media Accounts (0pts)**: Optionally, you can include links to valid social media. We highly recommend including your LinkedIn profile, not personal accounts such as Instagram.
    1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Settings.
    2. Under "Social accounts", in a blank "Link to social profile" field, type the full URL of the social account. For example, for the @GitHub Twitter account, type https://twitter.com/github.
    3. Click Update profile.
